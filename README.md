# Overview

SEON's Device Fingerprinting SDK collects insights about the device associated to a user and allows developers to integrate device identification into native Android apps.

Account takeovers, multiple account signups and payments can easily be avoided by using SEON's Device Fingerprinting SDK.


## Requirements
- Android 5.0 or higher (API level 21)
- **INTERNET** permission
- _(optional)_ **READ_PHONE_STATE** permission for `device_cellular_id` (under API 28) and the full functionality of `is_on_call`
- _(optional)_ **ACCESS_WIFI_STATE** permission for `wifi_ssid` (under API 27)
- _(optional)_ **ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** permission for `network_config` for WiFi configurations and **READ_PHONE_STATE** for cellular data configurations
- _(optional)_ **ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION** (starting from API 29) and **ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION** (starting from API 27) permission for `wifi_mac_address`, `wifi_ssid`, `device_location`*
- _(optional)_ **ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION** (starting from API 29) permission for to get location updates even if the application is in the background
- _(optional)_ **com.google.android.providers.gsf.permission.READ_GSERVICES** for `gsf_id`

> __Note:__ If the optional permissions listed are not available the application, the values collected using those permissions will be ignored. We recommend using as much permission as possible based on your use-case to provide reliable device fingerprint.

> __*device_location:__ Please see the Geolocation Integration section for more info

## Installation

#### Using Gradle with Groovy

```
dependencies {
  implementation 'io.seon.androidsdk:androidsdk:6.7.1'
}
```

#### Using Gradle with Kotlin DSL

```
dependencies {
    implementation("io.seon.androidsdk:androidsdk:6.7.1")
}
```

### Known issues in previous versions
If there's a duplicate class error due to conflicting versions of the Bouncy Castle dependency in `6.3.0` and `6.4.0`, which could look like the following error message:
```
Duplicate class org.bouncycastle.LICENSE found in modules jetified-bcprov-jdk14-1.77 (org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk14:1.77) and jetified-bcprov-jdk18on-1.77 (org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk18on:1.77)
```
In this case, please add the following line to the SDK's implementation block to remove SEON's version of the module:
```
exclude group: 'org.bouncycastle', module: 'bcprov-jdk14'
```
---

On earlier versions you might to need to include the following ProGuard rule to avoid JNI runtime errors :
```
-keepclasseswithmembers,includedescriptorclasses class io.seon.androidsdk.service.JNIHandler {
   native <methods>;
}
```


## Integration

>### __Note:__ Starting from v6 there is a change in SEON’s API Policy. From now on SEON might introduce new fields in the SDK with minor versions. We advise you to integrate in a way that addition of new fields is handled gracefully.

### Kotlin Integration
```
val sessionID = "CUSTOM_SESSION_ID"

// Build the Seon object with the required parameters
// an application context and a session_id
//
// Optional - You can optionally set a custom timeout for the SDK's network call
// with passing the following method to SeonBuilder: withDnsTimeout(int timeoutInMillisec)
// Note: Passing 0 here effectively skips the network logic which in turn won't
// populate the Fraud API fields with device_ip_* and dns_ip_* prefixes

val sfp = SeonBuilder().withContext(applicationContext).withSessionId(sessionID).build()

// Optional - Enable logging
sfp.setLoggingEnabled(true)

try {
    sfp.getFingerprintBase64 { seonFingerprint: String? ->
        //set seonFingerprint as the value for the session
        //property of your Fraud API request.
    }
} catch (e : SeonException){
    e.printStackTrace()
}

```
### Java Integration

```
final String SESSION_ID = "CUSTOM_SESSION_ID";

// Build the Seon object with the required parameters
// an application context and a session_id
//
// Optional - You can optionally set a custom timeout for the SDK's network call
// with passing the following method to SeonBuilder: withDnsTimeout(int timeoutInMillisec)
// Note: Passing 0 here effectively skips the network logic which in turn won't
// populate the Fraud API fields with device_ip_* and dns_ip_* prefixes

Seon seonFingerprint = new SeonBuilder()
    .withContext(getApplicationContext())
    .withSessionId(SESSION_ID)
    .build();

// Optional - Enable logging
seonFingerprint.setLoggingEnabled(true);

try {
    seonFingerprint.getFingerprintBase64(fp->{
        //set fp as the value for the session property of the fraud API request.
    });
} catch (SeonException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

# Behaviour Monitoring (Optional)
Behaviour Monitoring allows the SEON SDK to be able to detect potentially suspicious user behaviour on the device. The SDK collects data during the session, which is then analyzed to identify potentially fraudulent environments and actions. This feature enhances the SDK’s ability to prevent fraud by detecting various forms of automated or suspicious activity, such as bot usage or device farms.

>__Note:__ For the result of the behaviour evaluation, we are introducing a new response field in the Fraud API response named `suspicious_flags`. It's available in sessions generated by Android SDK version 6.5.0 or later when the session had been generated by the new `startBehaviourMonitoring` and `stopBehaviourMonitoring` interfaces.

The monitoring must be started with calling `startBehaviourMonitoring` wherever you would like to detect suspicious activity in your application and should be stopped with `stopBehaviourMonitoring` whenever it's reasonable. The returned session string should be then used in a Fraud API request as usual. Note: If you call `stopBehaviourMonitoring` without `startBehaviourMonitoring` called previously, the method will exit with `BehaviouralMonitoringException` thrown.

### Possible `suspicious_flags` values:
-	`"possible_automation"`: Suggests that automation tools or scripts may be controlling the device.
-	`"possible_device_farm"`: Suggests that the device might be part of a device farm used for fraudulent activities.
-	`"possible_vishing"`: Flags possible vishing (voice phishing) activity, where the user might be coerced into providing sensitive information.
-	`"possible_ongoing_call"`: Flags possible ongoing phone call, which could be useful information in case the **READ_PHONE_STATE** permission wasn't granted for `is_on_call` field to work. This behaviour based flag does not need any permissions to work, but it's only a best-effort metric.
- **To be continuously improved and extended with new signals**

### Java Integration

```
final String SESSION_ID = "CUSTOM_SESSION_ID";

// Build the Seon object with the required parameters
// an application context and a session_id
//
// Optional - You can optionally set a custom timeout for the SDK's network call
// with passing the following method to SeonBuilder: withDnsTimeout(int timeoutInMillisec)
// Note: Passing 0 here effectively skips the network logic which in turn won't
// populate the Fraud API fields with device_ip_* and dns_ip_* prefixes

Seon seonFingerprint = new SeonBuilder()
    .withContext(getApplicationContext())
    .withSessionId(SESSION_ID)
    .build();

// Optional - Enable logging
seonFingerprint.setLoggingEnabled(true);

//To get behaviour based signals, you have to start monitoring before the relevant user journey:
seonFinderprint.startBehaviourMonitoring();

/* ---- Relevant user journey happens here ----
* Note: The behaviour analysis needs time to collect signals on user behaviour,
* so it's advisable to run it at least for a few seconds.
*/

try {
    //When you want to collect the results, call stopBehaviourMonitoring() as you would getFingerprintBase64()
    seonFingerprint.stopBehaviourMonitoring(fp->{
        //set fp as the value for the session property of the fraud API request.
        //fp contains everything you would get from getFingerprintBase64(), plus the occasional behavioural results
    });
} catch (BehaviouralMonitoringException e) {
    //Handle behavioural monitoring failure
    e.printStackTrace();
}
catch (SeonException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

```

## Geolocation Integration (Opt-in)
**To enable SEON’s geolocation feature on your account please reach out the customer success team to enable the functionality on your Admin page and your Scoring Engine!**

> __Note:__ Currently even if the integration has been done correctly there won't be a **device_location** field in the Fraud API response until the feature flag has been set by our customer success team.

> Note: Android SDK Version 6.6.0 or higher and the following Geolocation integration setup is required to use the Geofence API. For further information please visit https://docs.seon.io/api-reference/geofence-api

### Important: Collecting consent and necessary permissions from the end user for location tracking is required.

Use the `SeonGeolocationConfig` object created with `SeonGeolocationConfigBuilder` to customise how geolocation is collected or just use the instance as-is for default values. The following properties are available on object:
- `setGeolocationEnabled` - Setter to enable or disable geolocation collection. Defaults to false.
- `setPrefetchEnabled` - By passing true the geolocation service is going to pre-fetch a valid location as soon as a `Seon` object is created. Defaults to true.
- `setMaxGeoLocationCacheAgeSec` - Sets the maximum allowed age of a location object in seconds. Default value is 600.
- `setGeolocationServiceTimeoutMs` - Sets the maximum time in milliseconds `getFingerprintBase64` or `stopBehaviourMonitoring` can wait for a valid location. Default value is 3000.

Make sure you call `setGeolocationConfig` on `Seon` before calling `getFingerprintBase64` or `stopBehaviourMonitoring` for the SDK to enrich the collected device information with location data.
For the most accurate results when using the Geofence API, prefer Behaviour Monitoring over simply calling `getFingerprintBase64`. Refer to the relevant section in the documentation about how to set up and use Behaviour Monitoring.

To receive status codes about the geolocation collection, pass the `SeonCallbackWithGeo` interface to `getFingerprintBase64` or `stopBehaviourMonitoring`. Example:

#### Java:

```
// You should initialise the Seon SDK, enable geolocation collection and prompt the user for appropriate location permission(s) before trying to retrieve a fingerprint with valid location data.
// ...
seon.getFingerprintBase64(new SeonCallbackWithGeo() {
    @Override
    public void onComplete(String response) {
        // Successfully received fingerprint response with device location data.
    }
    @Override
    public void onCompleteWithGeoFailure(String response, int geoStatusCode) {
        // Successfully received fingerprint response, without valid location data and geolocation service status code.
    }
});
```

#### Kotlin:
```
// You should initialize the Seon SDK, enable geolocation collection, 
// and prompt the user for appropriate location permission(s) before 
// trying to retrieve a fingerprint with valid location data.
// ...

seon.getFingerprintBase64(object : SeonCallbackWithGeo {
    override fun onComplete(response: String) {
        // Successfully received fingerprint response with device location data.
    }

    override fun onCompleteWithGeoFailure(response: String, geoStatusCode: Int) {
        // Successfully received fingerprint response, without valid location data and geolocation service status code.
    }
})
```

The SDK can return the following Geolocation specific status codes in the `onCompleteWithGeoFailure`  callback as the value of `geoStatusCode`:
- `-1` : `Unknown` : An unknown error has occured during geolocation collection.
- `1` : `Fail` : Failed to return location data.
- `2` : `Timeout` : The location service has timed out.
- `3` : `No Permission` : The user has denied the use of location services.
- `4` : `No Provider` : There are currently no available location providers to determine the device’s position.
- `5` : `Disabled` : Location services are disabled on the device.
- `6` : `No Support` : There's no location service support.

### Kotlin Integration
```
// Create a custom Geolocation Config object
val seonGeolocationConfig = SeonGeolocationConfigBuilder()
    .withPrefetchEnabled(true) // When enabled, prefetch location from the API on init for better performance
    .withGeolocationServiceTimeoutMs(3000) // The timeout in milliseconds for the location service
    .withMaxGeoLocationCacheAgeSec(600) // Maximum Location data age permitted in seconds
    .build()

val seon = SeonBuilder()
    .withContext(applicationContext)
    .withSessionId(UUID.randomUUID().toString())
    .withGeolocationEnabled() // must be explicitly enabled to turn on the Geolocation feature
    .withGeoLocationConfig(seonGeolocationConfig) // optional config
    .build()

// Geolocation and SeonGeolocationConfig can also be set later on the Seon object
seon.setGeolocationEnabled(true)
seon.setGeoLocationConfig(seonGeolocationConfig)

```

### Java Integration
```
// Create a custom Geolocation Config object
        SeonGeolocationConfig seonGeolocationConfig = new SeonGeolocationConfigBuilder()
                .withPrefetchEnabled(true) // When enabled, prefetch location from the API on init for better performance
                .withGeolocationServiceTimeoutMs(3000) // The timeout in milliseconds for the location service
                .withMaxGeoLocationCacheAgeSec(600) // Maximum Location data age permitted in seconds
                .build();

        seon = new SeonBuilder()
                .withContext(getApplicationContext())
                .withSessionId(UUID.randomUUID().toString())
                .withGeolocationEnabled() // must be explicitly enabled to turn on the Geolocation feature
                .withGeoLocationConfig(seonGeolocationConfig) // optional config
                .build();

        // Geolocation and SeonGeolocationConfig can also be set later on the Seon object
        seon.setGeolocationEnabled(true);
        seon.setGeoLocationConfig(seonGeolocationConfig);
```
